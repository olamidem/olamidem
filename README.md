At my present position at APIN PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION, I am responsible for data analysis and interpretation in order to support strategic choices and enhance care quality. To clean, modify, and display data, I frequently utilize Microsoft Excel, SQL, Power Bi, and Python. I am committed to providing clients with honest and practical advice.
