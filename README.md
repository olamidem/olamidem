Hey and welcome! My name is Olamide M. Olagunju, 

I work as a data analyst in the public health sector. I'm fascinated by the power of data to find insights, spot patterns, and solve complex problems that influence business choices.

At my present position at APIN PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION, I am responsible for data analysis and interpretation in order to support strategic choices and enhance care quality. To clean, modify, and display data, I frequently utilize Microsoft Excel, SQL, Power Bi, and Python. I am committed to providing clients with honest and practical advice.
