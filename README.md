### Hi there and welcome, I'm Olamide M. OlagunjuðŸ‘‹

As a data analyst in the public health sector, I am captivated by the potential of data to uncover insights, identify patterns, and solve complex challenges that impact business decisions. By harnessing the power of data, I aim to drive informed and effective strategies that improve public health outcomes.

In addition, I possess extensive experience as a full-stack developer, specializing in frontend development with React.js and managing backend operations with Laravel. With over 4 years of experience, I have built a strong foundation in creating scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that cater to diverse business needs.
